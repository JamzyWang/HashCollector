// MurmurHash, by Zheming

// Note - This code makes a few assumptions about how your machine behaves -

// 1. We can read a 4-byte value from any address without crashing
// 2. sizeof(int) == 4

// And it has a few limitations -

// 1. It will not work incrementally.
// 2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
//    machines.


// Changing the seed value will totally change the output of the hash.
// If you don't have a preference, use a seed of 0.

unsigned int MurmurHash ( const void * key, int len, unsigned int seed )
{
    // 'm' and 'r' are mixing constants generated offline.
    // They're not really 'magic', they just happen to work well.

    const int r = 16;

    unsigned int h = seed ^ (len * m);
 
    // Mix 4 bytes at a time into the hash
